# politics
code to automate political survey results and create meaningful data visualizations and statistical analyses.

A good README.md file provides a clear and concise explanation of your Python script. For the script you built to analyze political survey results, here’s an outline of what typically goes into the README:

Political Survey Analyzer

Overview

Political Survey Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of analyzing political survey data. The script processes data from CSV or Excel files, generates marginals, pivot tables, descriptive statistics, and visualizations, and performs inferential statistical analyses to identify relationships among variables. It is especially useful for researchers, data analysts, and survey organizers.

Features

	1.	Input Handling:
	•	Accepts survey data in CSV or Excel format.
	•	User inputs sample size, error percentage, and confidence level.
	2.	Marginals:
	•	Generates a “marginals” report that replicates survey design, displaying:
	•	Each question.
	•	Answers with the number of respondents and percentage.
	3.	Pivot Tables:
	•	Automatically creates pivot tables broken down by demographics:
	•	Gender: Male, Female.
	•	Region: Northeast, South, Midwest, Pacific.
	•	Party Affiliation: Republican, Democrat, Undecided.
	•	Age Groups: 18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65+.
	•	Race: White, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Pacific Islander, Other.
	•	Education: Various levels.
	•	Income Levels.
	4.	Data Visualization:
	•	Creates bar charts for marginals.
	•	Saves visualizations in .png format.
	5.	Statistical Analysis:
	•	Performs chi-square tests to explore relationships among survey variables and demographics.
	6.	Export Options:
	•	Saves results in plain text (marginals_output.txt) and Excel (pivot_tables_output.xlsx).
	•	Option to print results.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Libraries:
	•	pandas: For data manipulation.
	•	numpy: For numerical operations.
	•	matplotlib: For visualizations.
	•	scipy: For statistical analysis.
	•	openpyxl: For handling Excel files.

Install the required dependencies with:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy openpyxl

Usage

Step 1: Run the Script

Execute the script in your Python environment:

python political_survey_analyzer.py

Step 2: Provide Inputs

Follow the prompts:
	1.	Enter the sample size, error percentage, and confidence level.
	2.	Upload your survey data in CSV or Excel format.

Step 3: Analyze Results

The script will:
	•	Process your data and generate marginals.
	•	Create pivot tables categorized by demographics.
	•	Perform chi-square tests to identify statistically significant relationships.
	•	Save visualizations and outputs.

Outputs

	1.	Marginals Report:
	•	A text-based summary (marginals_output.txt) showing questions, answers, and statistics.
	2.	Pivot Tables:
	•	Excel file (pivot_tables_output.xlsx) containing breakdowns of survey responses by demographics.
	3.	Visualizations:
	•	Bar charts (Question_X_marginal_plot.png) for each survey question.

Example

Input

A CSV file containing survey results:

Question 1	Question 2	Gender	Age	Region	Party
Yes	Agree	Male	18-34	Midwest	Dem
No	Disagree	Female	35-49	South	Rep

Output

	1.	Marginals:

1. Do you support Policy X?
   Yes ........ n = 500, % = 50.00
   No ......... n = 500, % = 50.00

	2.	Pivot Table:
| Response | Male | Female | Northeast | Midwest | Rep | Dem |
|–––––|——|––––|———–|———|—–|—–|
| Yes      | 250  | 250    | 100       | 150     | 200 | 300 |
| No       | 250  | 250    | 150       | 100     | 300 | 200 |
	3.	Visualization:
Bar charts for question responses.

Statistical Analysis

The script performs chi-square tests to detect significant relationships between survey responses and demographic variables. For example:
	•	p-value < 0.05 indicates a significant relationship between variables.
